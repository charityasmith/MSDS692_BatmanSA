Movie,Review
Batman,"Tim Burton's Batman is a Gothic superhero movie that embraced artifice and shunned grounded reality, and it was better for it."
Batman,"Set to Danny Elfman’s triumphant score, Burton’s first Batman movie will live eternal in how it irreversibly changed movies and turned Keaton into a movie star overnight."
Batman,"The result is a film that may please adults more than youngsters, and isn't that refreshing?"
Batman,The Gotham City created in Batman is one of the most distinctive and atmospheric places I’ve seen in the movies. It’s a shame something more memorable doesn’t happen there.
Batman,"It is both a technical and aesthetic triumph, a fact made all the more impressive since the movie was almost buried in its own hype before anyone had seen it."
Batman,"One of the most interesting comic-book movies ever made, a movie that vividly illustrates where most of the others have gone wrong."
Batman,"The movie is underwritten, but it has so many unpredictable spins that what's missing doesn't seem to matter much. It's mean and anarchic and blissful."
Batman,"Batman tries to span the uncharted area between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Blue Velvet, which is worthy of notice. That it fails may be because of Tim Burton's lack of narrative cohesion."
Batman,"Batman, despite the disconcerting mood changes, remains a forceful, visually hypnotic movie with enough pulse-pounding action and seething tension to nail most audiences to their seats even if they feel cheated in the end."
Batman,"There is real boldness and wild humor in Tim Burton's gloomy, sinister version of the ultimate in comic book noir. Burton is a former animator with so much genuine daftness and visual ingenuity that even a clunky corporate machine can't quell it."
Batman,"It's halfway between an opera and a comic book, but it chooses the worst parts of each. It hasn't the comic book's antic rhythms, but it hasn't an opera's depth of passion."
Batman,"Keaton must project a whole lot without saying very much, and convince you that no, he's not a mild-mannered wimp, he's just cautious. He does convince. But Nicholson has all the great lines; he's so good he puts a spin on the hammiest, hoariest jokes."
Batman,Batman is perfect summertime fare. Its secret is levity hidden in a dark and troubled soul.
Batman,"All the incredible sets and effects can't mask a half-baked story. The atmosphere is dazzling; the narrative, which sometimes lurches along, is forgettable."
Batman,"Boasts the adventure of Indiana Jones, the humor of the original Ghostbusters, the terror of Friday the 13th and the ingenuity of a post-modern classic. Better yet, it contains a performance by Jack Nicholson that's so mesmerizing it won't be forgotten."
Batman,"Batman is a feast for the eyes and ears, with Anton Furst's massive, elegantly ugly sets of Gotham City, Danny Elfman's lovely, classically-oriented score, and dazzling special effects. It is also one long gas, thanks to Jack Nicholson."
Batman,"Watching the tale unfold, you sense that with each film Burton is going to get even better. There's a maniacal gloom to his work balanced by a wacky sense of humor."
Batman,"It is exhilarating in its sheer, protean excess of styles, appearances, allusions, gestures, and decor. But it also marks the supersedence of set decor and costume over more traditionally important cinematic values. such as narrative, character and theme."
Batman,"Tim Burton's Batman is spectacular entertainment, as exciting as it is visionary, and as much fun as it is darkly original."
Batman,"The thing that's going to make you want to see Batman a second and third and fourth time is Gotham City as a brutal pile of dour, gothic, Art Deco menace."
Batman,"On one hand, Batman is a brooding, ambitious, psychologically sensitive saga of dark motivations and shadowy desires. On the other, it's a dazzling piece of comic absurdity. Only in rare places do the two approaches gel."
Batman,"Batman always fascinates the eye, but too often it leaves the emotions, the intellect, the soul unsatisfied."
Batman,"While it is frequently a visionary film of surpassing beauty, intelligence and originality, it is also coolly personal, which will [come] as a shock to people who are expecting a populist entertainment."
Batman,"An extraordinary visual and aural experience, echoing and reverberating with allusions to ""Kane,"" Fritz Lang's Metropolis, even Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo."
Batman,Tim Burton's film is precision machinery... But the film loses sight of plain storytelling. It is ultimately as unsatisfying as any numbers of pictures that have sought and failed to translate comic-book narrative to cinema.
Batman,"Fact is, Batman has almost everything going for it except a strong script, and sometimes even that doesn't matter."
Batman,"You come away dazzled by the production, giggling at Jack Nicholson's antics -- yes, he's the ideal Joker -- and satisfied by Michael Keaton's acting, though he's too small to play Batman. But you never learn the ""why"" of things."
Batman,"Mostly, and amazingly, Batman does not die beneath the weight of promotion: it liveth. Its passionate and in all senses ""batty"" extravagance fills the screen."
Batman,"Alas, Mr. Keaton is totally gobbled up, by Nicholson if not by Basinger. And so it comes to pass that the story is quite gobbled up too, ponderously trying for liftoff but seldom managing more than a quirky sequence or so at a time."
Batman,The failure to furnish a pair of fairly matched foes is the central flaw in Tim Burton's otherwise flamboyantly enjoyable movie. It throws it off-balance. And Nicholson's own greedy appetite for satanic inventiveness hi-Jacks things his way further still.
Batman,"In one of the few summer movies that leave lasting images, you'll certainly remember the explosive Joker, who's like the graffiti the city spits onto its own walls. But even more, you'll remember the implosive Batman... In the end, it's his movie."
Batman,"No, it is not the best summer movie. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is far better, and even Ghostbusters II is more fun. Yes, it is worth seeing, even with all its clearly evident flaws."
Batman,"It's by turns brilliantly inspired, infuriatingly unfocused, hilarious, boring, exhilarating, gloomy and empty. The film's abundant virtues wrestle with its shortcomings."
Batman,"Even on its woefully rickety story level, the movie has emotional force and conviction; it acquires a haunting aura and a pop Wagnerian ring."
Batman,"I wouldn't say Batman is an awful movie, but when I felt as if I'd been sitting for two hours, I looked at m watch and discovered we were only 35 minutes into the story."
Batman,"Batman is a giddy, disturbing ride through movies and myths past and present. In short, Batman is terrific -- funny, smart and sensitive too, the perfect cinematic date."
Batman,"A tedious film, a cardboard anti-adventure. [Full review in Spanish]"
Batman,"Many a picture has better writing and acting, truer characters, more exciting incidents, more authentic creative creations -- and no less costly publicity. Yet something in Batman must appeal uniquely to the mass imagination... Batman is folklore now."
Batman,A complete and perfectly balanced film from start to finish. [Full review in Spanish]
Batman,"It's not the kind of pushy escapist summer movie that eagerly grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go. Rather, it casually brushes by and, attracted to it, you can't stay away. It's magnetic."
Batman,If you thought Nicholson went over the edge in The Shining... you'll think he's plunging into hyperspace with his frightening freak-outs and day-go derangement. Batman is worth watching just to see this master actor soar unrestrained.
Batman,"Nicholson is so superb here that he lifts the whole enterprise into the stratosphere of summer movies. As they say, he alone is worth the price of admission."
Batman,"It's actually refreshing to discover a comic book story that wants to look different. Tim Burton's Batman is a bit like the same director's Beetlejuice -- it's got style, a flavor of its, juicy and tangy."
Batman,Batman is one of the most intelligent blockbusters of the year. That's a backhanded compliment for a film which flounders trying to have it both ways by blending cartoonish kiddie action with psychological thrills for adults.
Batman,"It's Nicholson the ham at his worst, though the lacklustre lines he has been given certainly haven't helped him. Batman is often stunning to look at. But, ultimately, it's a real disappointment."
Batman,"The role is deal for Nicholson. At last, his leaning towards hamming it up comes into its own. My heart lifted when he appeared on the screen -- even though he is meant to be the incarnation of evil."
Batman,"Tim Burton has an extraordinary imagination and a flair for brilliant, excessive comic moments, but he doesn't seem interested either in telling a story or sustaining the internal consistency that even fantasy requires."
Batman,"In sum, this over-touted phenomenon is a thumping good action movie, with a witty script; it should be seen in 70mm and heard in THX sound. In real life, however, as in the final reel, it is Mr. Nicholson who has the last laugh."
Batman,"The film occupies a sort of limbo, belonging to the genre of fantasy but excluded from its pleasures, equally cut off from childhood and maturity, and frustrating rather than rewarding any surrender from an audience."
Batman,"To concentrate too heavily on the film's comic origins is to miss its grasp of Cinema with a capital ""C,"" the way it resonates with archetypal Hollywood imagery while giving its audience something it feels it hasn't experienced before."
Batman,"Owing little to the jokey super heroics of the '60s television show, this revisionist Batman is thrilling in its subversive fusion of visionary set design and kinky sociopathology, special-effects wizardry and sophisticated wit."
Batman,"Engaging, comic and non-threatening when it might have been dangerous and mesmerizingly hard to take. But given the current alternatives, we should be grateful for the pleasures provided, even as we indulge in little sighs of regret."
Batman,Nicholson's unhinged brilliance sets the tone for the much-ballyhooed Batman. It's nasty stuff. This is not the camp cartoon classic of comic books and TV that millions of kids have been weaned on. This is psycho-comedy in the purest sense.
Batman,"In Batman, the Joker finally gets the better of the hero. He pulls off the crime of the century right below the Caped Crusader's nose: He steals his movie."
Batman,"Even when Nicholson is just being Nicholson, as he has done for many movies now, he does it with a vigor and a delight that is infectious. The other great plus here is Basinger, who brings tremendous dimension to a thinly written part."
Batman,Batman comes about as close as possible to living up to its hype. It is an entertaining and visually attractive film that features two wonderful performances.
Batman,"An iconic and enthralling vision of Batman's gothic world, from its characters to its sets and props, with notable performances and powerful music."
Batman,You can see Burton’s fingerprints and those of his collaborators on every frame. What now feels like a rarity in an industry where IP is often valued above craft was absolutely fundamental to every facet of the experience.
Batman,"Batman is a fun mishmash of adventure, humor and horror that doesn’t take itself too seriously but isn’t without some subtlety."
Batman,We enjoyed the movie. Our main complaint is we went to see a movie titled Batman because we wanted to see a movie about Batman. But what we got was a movie titled Batman that was about the Joker.
Batman,"A fascinating watercolor in purple and black, with a surprisingly subtle performance by Michael Keaton."
Batman,"The movie resonates with old-fashioned gangster flavor. Very portentous, very noir."
Batman,"Batman is not a children's spectacle, but once past that obstacle it’s a strange thing, a film that crosses borders. [Full review in Spanish]"
Batman,"Batman, the movie event of the summer, is a psycho thriller posing as an action-adventure movie, a breathtaking ride through a fun-house populated with all-too-believable ghouls, phantoms and tortured souls."
Batman,A groundbreaking comic book adaptation.
Batman,"Like Gotham City, Batman is a little rough at times, but Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson's wonderfully weird performances (and Tim Burton's unique vision for the DC Universe) mean it deserves to be remembered as a classic."
Batman,"This might have been a great film if someone had bothered to hire a writer capable of creating fresh, intelligent dialogue."
Batman,I found that I really enjoyed the film.
Batman,The theatrical release of Batman celebrates 30 years this year and holds up for being the product of its era with regards to cinematic entertainment.
Batman,"Directed by Tim Burton, the movie has a brooding noir feel."
Batman,I don't get the appeal to be honest.
Batman,"Other than its prescience as a pop cultural milestone, this won't go down as one of the better superhero movies, nor even one of the best in the Batman cinematic canon."
Batman,The new Batman is the most intelligent film ever made from a comic book.
Batman,"Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton."
Batman,"Nicholson isn't only offering a brilliant bit of self-parody here, he's doing it in service to the character"
Batman,"It is, unfortunately, awfully difficult to revisit Tim Burton's Batman with an impartial eye in the wake of Christopher Nolan's genre-defining Dark Knight trilogy..."
Batman,Nicholson's Joker is a villain worthy of a real superhero and Keaton's Batman gets to perform some cinematic superheroics of the first order.
Batman,Highly recommended even for fans who think Batman begins and ends with Nolan's trilogy.
Batman,It's an unforgivably flat ending for a movie of such astonishing contours. But its first two-thirds -- which should be called The Joker's Big Misadventure -- is probably the best film of the year.
Batman,"[Nicholson] has never been more commanding. Not only because he does an outstanding job, but also because so much of the movie's creative energy is devoted to making the Joker one of the most startling movie characters in recent memory."
Batman,"Batman is a winner. It fills the screen with dark, daring dreams. This bat flies."
Batman,"As Robin might have said of this semi-boondoggle: ""Holy overkill!"""
Batman,"The idea of doing a dark, neurotic, highly stylized and highly claustrophobic superproduction is an audacious and appealing one, but director Tim Burton has only made it halfway there."
Batman,"Michael Keaton makes a credible hero, and Jack Nicholson is downright manic as his nemesis."
Batman,"Is it interesting? Fitfully. Is it fun? Not much, Gotham City fans, not much."
Batman,"Even though its standing has diminished in the wake of the countless superhero flicks that emerged in the new millennium, the pros still outweigh the cons."
Batman,"Only minor Burton, with hindsight on our side, and its chief merits and flaws are as one of the formative texts of superhero cinema."
Batman,"While Keaton and Nicholson are dazzling in their roles, Burton never quite finds much to explore with Bruce Wayne, and that's wasted potential."
Batman,This movie is a hot mess.
Batman,"Stylish, violent, and often dull Batman adventure."
Batman,"A dark and refreshing interpretation of one of comic kingdom's most beloved characters, Batman successfully wiped away the memory of the camp 1960s television show and proved that comic book movies can be highly entertaining viewing."
Batman,"The element of surprise appears in every frame of this motion picture, creating a rich sense of joy and mystery that seems to befuddle Burton and his primitive instincts."
Batman,...Batman hasn't gone totally stale.
Batman,"Visually arresting but dramatically undernourished, the film suffers from bland characterization (particularly by Basinger's Vicki and the other ""good"" crime fighters) and is ultimately saved by Jack Nicholson's bravura turn as the diabolical Joker."
Batman,A void of underdeveloped style and halfhearted execution.
Batman,"Supposedly a superhero movie for grown-ups, this is actually a pretentious farrago."
Batman,"It was, however, easily the biggest box-office hit of 1989, and one of the highest grossing films in history, a testament more to its massive marketing campaign than to its quality."
Batman,Director Tim Burton effectively echoes the visual style of the original Bob Kane comics while conjuring up a nightmarish world of his own.
Batman,The conceptual side of the movie--two rather sick two-sided antagonists having it out in a black and sordid context -- lingers.
Batman,Wow. I can't believe how little I enjoyed about this movie after all of these years of NOT having seen it.
Batman,"Burton brings back film noir elements to the new Batman, elevating it to a dark, demented opera."
Batman,"In the end, one's reaction to Burton's blockbuster is little more than that of the Joker to Batman: 'Where did he get those wonderful toys?'"
Batman,"Jack Nicholson provides the colour in this gloomy expressionist world, which has since become a Burton trademark."
Batman,"The story is a mess… Scenes and lines of dialogue make no sense… Keaton makes hardly any impression in the role, in or out of the mask."
Batman,...the yardstick by which all subsequent Batman movies are measured.
Batman,
Batman,A cynical cinematic masterpiece.
Batman,"Despite a handful of good minor performances -- Michael Gough is the definitive Alfred -- and despite some striking bits of music from Prince, it really has nothing of its own to offer."
Batman,That Nicholson could make this homicidal maniac so sympathetic is a testament to his performance.
Batman,"As a movie spectacle, it delivered. As Batman, well...it got a lot of things wrong."
Batman,
Batman,"Uneven in tone, but Keaton's great and the movie just looks like a million bucks."
Batman,
Batman,"Despite its failings...a hugely influential movie with literally towering design, mordant wit, and a hall-of-fame performance by Jack Nicholson."
Batman,
Batman,[It] provides two hours of more than solid entertainment.
Batman,
Batman,
Batman,A dark reinvention of the Batman legend; the only offkey piece is Jack Nicholson's way over the top performance.
Batman,"Good film...it kind of reeks of the '80s now, but it's still dark fun."
Batman,
Batman,
Batman,
Batman,"The wit is all pictorial. The film meanders mindlessly from one image to the next, as does a comic book. It doesn't help that the title character remains such a wimp even when played by Michael Keaton."
Batman,Gloomy and not particularly entertaining
Batman,"Overly dark, broody, and campy. A disservice to the classic TV show and the more serious comic series."
Batman,
Batman,"Tim Burton is a genius when it comes to set design and atmosphere, but he can't film an action sequence to save his life."
Batman,"Langourously paced, but compelling rethinking"
Batman,"There are a lot of things wrong with Batman, but it still makes for decent entertainment in the fine tradition of the typical low-intelligence summer movie."
Batman,A celebration of form over story
Batman,Tim Burton's Batman manages to avoid all the potholes that the Batman story might have strewn in the way of an unwary filmmaker and he manages to avoid them all with aplomb.
Batman,"...a success for several reasons, but most of the credit goes to director Tim Burton's brilliant visual interpretation of a dark, ominous comic book."
Batman,"I guess I did not expect better, but I had hoped for it nonetheless."
Batman,"An exhilarating mix of cartoon lore (though not nearly enough for rabid Batpurists), screen presence (this is pretty much the Jack and Mike Show), psychological murkiness (though it could have used even more) and demented Gothic goofiness."
Batman,"Was it worth the wait? Actually, yes."
Batman,It's just plain fun.
Batman,Nicholson does indeed blow everybody else off the screen. Sometimes it seems this movie should be called Joker instead of Batman.
Batman,"Dark, haunting and poetic"
Batman,"Which way do you go: play it for laughs, like the self-mocking Batman TV series of 1968-69; or strive for a literal, realistic approach? The makers of the 1989 Batman can't seem to make up their minds."
The Dark Knight,"With a memorable performance from Heath Ledger, masterful direction from Nolan, and bold storytelling, this film stands out as one of the best comic book adaptations in film history. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Dark Knight,It doesn’t matter how many superhero movies its crosstown rival makes; it’ll never match the brilliance that Nolan delivered the same year Marvel began its infinite project. Firing on all cylinders … this is the most complete film Nolan has ever made.
The Dark Knight,"For the longest time, I’ve viewed this film as the Godfather of live-action Batman films."
The Dark Knight,"The pinnacle of Nolan’s career so far, The Dark Knight is one of the most impressionable films of the 21st century (and one of the best)."
The Dark Knight,"An incomparable crime thriller and superhero film, and an instant classic in both genres"
The Dark Knight,A masterpiece within or outside the superhero & comic book genre it explores. Heath Ledger delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history. [Full review in Spanish]
The Dark Knight,A rare beast. It's a summer blockbuster with equal parts brain and brawn.
The Dark Knight,The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.
The Dark Knight,"With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling."
The Dark Knight,The awards hype is warranted.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the ""war on terror"" era."
The Dark Knight,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time."
The Dark Knight,It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.
The Dark Knight,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him."
The Dark Knight,"Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.
The Dark Knight,The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date
The Dark Knight,Heath Ledger is great.
The Dark Knight,"The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up."
The Dark Knight,"Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop."
The Dark Knight,"A film is only as good as its villain. By that standard, The Dark Knight achieves true greatness."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight always ought to be played on the biggest screen possible, and played loud, like a Led Zepplin song. Director Christopher Nolans' skyscapes, the helicopter shots and views from the 200th floor, are IMAX at its best."
The Dark Knight,"It might not be the most fun superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the most mature, complex and intriguing of them all. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight may not supply a happy ending, but there is a feeling of exhilaration as Batman rides off from the pursuing cops, and the realization that this is another big step forward for comic book movies."
The Dark Knight,The action sequences are like being injected with a shot of adrenalin straight into the heart.
The Dark Knight,"This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie"
The Dark Knight,"Too much psychology and not enough pop. It's possible to be too serious, you know."
The Dark Knight,"Pretty deep stuff from a popcorn picture, and it's one reason why the movie theaters right now are such a rich vein of entertainment."
The Dark Knight,One of the most stylish extravaganzas in years.
The Dark Knight,"As summer movies go, The Dark Knight is head and shoulders above most."
The Dark Knight,You will feel utterly numb after the screening of The Dark Knight. The film is bleak and brilliant.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight may mirror the ethical dilemmas & duplicities of the War on Terror, but it also offers a different, better way through them, with a seriousness that Bush & his clowns were never able to muster"
The Dark Knight,The weight of expectation should have crushed this movie.
The Dark Knight,"Nolan has squeezed enough material for a saga into two and a half hours. The action moves insanely fast, the exposition is breathless, and the big setpieces practically tread on each other's heels. Down time doesn't exist in this film."
The Dark Knight,Declaring Christopher Nolan's Batman movie to be the best-ever comic book adaptation or one of the top action flicks of all time understates what he accomplishes.
The Dark Knight,"This is an impressive film in many ways, and Nolan directs with real confidence, yet the overall result feels cumbersome."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is a clever, loud, technically brilliant film, superbly designed by Nathan Crowley and dramatically lit by Wally Pfister. Whether such a movie can bear the increasing moral weight imposed upon it is another matter."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is a triumph from beginning to end.
The Dark Knight,"The phenomenal The Dark Knight now reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to its bittersweet last, it sets a new standard for the genre -- and redefines what a summer popcorn movie can be."
The Dark Knight,Among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts and setpieces you expect in summer blockbusters.
The Dark Knight,"Brilliantly bleak and chillingly Gothic (credit the enthralling cinematography by Wally Pfister), The Dark Knight emerges as the first truly great film of 2008."
The Dark Knight,"The most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex and most viscerally thrilling super-hero movie of all. It transcends the genre."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight takes the process a giant leap further, transforming a typical summer blockbuster into a brooding, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil."
The Dark Knight,Does it match the hype? Yes.
The Dark Knight,"At two and a half hours, it's a little exhausting, but I honestly can't say what I'd cut."
The Dark Knight,"Dark, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish, Batman's return to the big screen has set a new benchmark for the superhero film, leaving the plethora of recent comic book capers firmly in its wake."
The Dark Knight,"It's too long and Nolan tosses in too many twists near the end. But it delivers ongoing adrenalin rushes, mental popcorn to chew over and a rich atmosphere to get lost in. And it's impressive enough to rank as summer's strongest blockbuster."
The Dark Knight,Most of the film is entertaining. The cast is uniformly excellent and the resounding praise aimed at the late Heath Ledger is deserved.
The Dark Knight,"Christopher Nolan's rich and engrossing adventure rip-roars across the cinema screen, bullying blockbusters into new territory."
The Dark Knight,"To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas."
The Dark Knight,"If Batman Begins was the classy hors d'oeuvre in Christopher Nolan's blockbuster trilogy, then this awesome follow-up is a main course that delivers on all levels."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is a rarity in Hollywood -- a truly earnest adaptation that in many ways exceeds even the brilliance of the work upon which it is based.
The Dark Knight,Nolan's Dark Knight constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events. Ask yourself this: How long has it been since you've seen a movie like that?
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is probably the smartest and most stylish action movie since the ""The Matrix."" It thinks and philosophizes. The subject it thinks and philosophizes about, perhaps not surprisingly, considering the times, is the Iraq war."
The Dark Knight,"What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form. You learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down."
The Dark Knight,"Once firmly established, the bludgeoning pace of one Joker rampage after another pounds the film's carefully detailed collaboration into mush."
The Dark Knight,"[The Dark Knight] is the right movie at the right time, especially if you have a burning desire to be excited and depressed simultaneously."
The Dark Knight,"Sometimes it's easy to overlook the message in a film and just enjoy the action, but not here, as Nolan, Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, and compatriots take viewers on a compelling journey through moral ambiguity and the masks we all wear."
The Dark Knight,"An exceptionally smart, brooding picture with some terrific performances."
The Dark Knight,"Were films judged entirely by the emotive impact of their opening and closing images, The Dark Knight would be a masterpiece."
The Dark Knight,The glimpse into the Joker's darkness during his documented torture scene is a credit to the devastatingly lost potential of Heath Ledger.
The Dark Knight,"It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
The Dark Knight,"A phenomenal masterpiece whose creators aren't content with simply making a great comic book movie, but craft one that transcends the genre to become one of the best films this decade."
The Dark Knight,"Thank Warner Bros. for letting Nolan make such a smart, thrilling, emotionally involving, just terrifically well rounded and fully realized entertainment that challenges and elevates notions of what a so-called 'summer blockbuster' can do."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is the best kind of sequel -- one that uses its predecessor as a gateway to explore new facets of its characters and its world.
The Dark Knight,Visceral and terrifying.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is a film that's fantastic on the action front, seeds its acrobatics in its own reality, and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter."
The Dark Knight,"Even if this wasn't Ledger's final role before his untimely death last year, his Joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time."
The Dark Knight,"More than a comic-book adventure, this is a sprawling crime epic."
The Dark Knight,You know you're watching a good movie when it puts a smile on your face right from the start. In the The Dark Knight it may be a twisted grimace but given the right perspective there's enjoyment to be had in even the bleakest subject matter.
The Dark Knight,"Excellent sequel much darker, more violent than the first."
The Dark Knight,"Allusions to our current struggles with surveillance, public perception and terrorism are thrown into the mix, adding political immediacy to Nolan's psycho noir."
The Dark Knight,"With his sliced visage, enough knives to supply a steak-house chain, and makeup that makes Courtney Love's bad days look pretty, this Joker is the picture of pure evil."
The Dark Knight,"To simply call The Dark Knight a high class superhero film undercuts its true value. Themes that concern mans internal struggle with good and evil, and the corruptible nature of the soul, enhances the film to spectacular and often tense heights."
The Dark Knight,Bring on part three.
The Dark Knight,"Christopher Nolan is much, much smarter than your average filmmaker."
The Dark Knight,"Completely lacking in vanity, Ledger creates his finest performance."
The Dark Knight,Flawed and overrated.
The Dark Knight,"In this one, Gotham is finally a real city."
The Dark Knight,It not only surpasses Batman Begins - previously considered the high-water mark of movies about the Caped Crusader - but one that magnificently transcends the superhero genre.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is a masterpiece of the first order, and the first great post-Sept. 11 film."
The Dark Knight,"Middling as a summer blockbuster, zero as art, and more than a bit alarming as a phenomenon"
The Dark Knight,najefektniji u trenucima kada se kr%u0161e nepisana pravila
The Dark Knight,"Heath Ledger is Diana Ross and these other kids are The Supremes. Believe the hype, Mr. Ledger as The Joker is categorically brilliant. The late-great actor turned another Batman movie into a riveting film that will be Oscar worthy only because of him."
The Dark Knight,"Despite its superhero trappings, The Dark Knight is more a piece of film noir."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is a good movie. It has all the ingredients to be a great movie, but it isn't one. I may grudgingly put it on my best-ten-of-the year list (a paltry group at this point), but it could have been so much more. It came so close."
The Dark Knight,Can one great character carry an entire movie? ....the answer is obviously yes. Ledger does it.
The Dark Knight,"The symbiosis of good and evil is the film's philosophical core, and images of duality and cloaked identity are strewn through it like shards from a fun house mirror."
The Dark Knight,There is enough psychology thrown around to keep film classes in business for years.
The Dark Knight,"For all the Oscar buzz surrounding Heath Ledger in the past few weeks, there still aren't enough hours in the day to gush about his knockout performance as The Joker."
The Dark Knight,Lacks a sense of humor and a notion about the essential silliness of this premise.
The Dark Knight,"An amazing piece of filmmaking that rockets the Batman legacy to heights never imagined, fueled by Heath Ledger's amazing re-invention of The Joker."
The Dark Knight,"In The Dark Knight, when mortals tangle in the affairs of the gods, they get burned."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight delivered on many fronts.
The Dark Knight,a riveting piece of work that will have us all mourning Ledger's loss but smacking our lips for a third entry
The Dark Knight,"[Ledger gives] a bravura performance full of madness and menace, one that makes this clown truly frightening."
The Dark Knight,"I say this with a smile from ear to ear, there is too much of a good thing. The Dark Knight is the best adult superhero film of all time."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is the best Batman film ever made, the best superhero movie ever made, and the best movie of the year to date."
The Dark Knight,This is without a doubt the best -- and most important -- picture of the year.
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight has raised the bar for the comic book superhero genre - it's a Batman movie for grown-ups.
The Dark Knight,A big summer blockbuster dripping in characters.
The Dark Knight,This film is sure to surpass your wildest expectations. The summer film that is sure to be unforgettable and leave you craving for more.
The Dark Knight,"...even if Ledger hadn't died, critics and audiences alike would still be buzzing about the star's turn as The Joker."
The Dark Knight,"...we can have not just good comic book movies, but amazing comic book movies."
The Dark Knight,relatively high-quality pulp.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is neither a good nor a serious film. It is ill-conceived and poorly done, overlong, confusing and emotionally muddy."
The Dark Knight,"Powerful acting, powerful action, huge IMAX sequences give this Batman a great big commanding feel. However, story is held hostage to action, especially in the second half."
The Dark Knight,"Nolan gives in a bit to bloated-sequel syndrome ... but this is still one of the most riveting, trilling and wrenching movies of the year."
The Dark Knight,It could be the bleakest big-budget adventure since Blade Runner tanked on release near the dawn of the Reagan era.
The Dark Knight,"... director Christopher Nolan's much-hyped, long awaited second entry in the Batman franchise is not only fabulous and the best film of the summer, it's possibly the best film of the year, a guaranteed mammoth hit."
The Dark Knight,"""So here it is: The best superhero movie ever. The Dark Knight deftly accomplishes all one could hope for, and then it surpasses it, and then it continues to surprise. The movie isn't just a triumph, it is that rare pop-culture oddity: A masterpiece."""
The Dark Knight,...many excellent moments and action set-pieces...
The Dark Knight,"Be not fooled, this movie may circle D.A. Harvey Dent, and may toy with Wayne's weariness and loneliness, but this story belongs heart and soul to Ledger's Joker."
The Dark Knight,[Ledger's] manic zest gives the film its energy.
The Dark Knight,"You will exit the cinema with an enhanced respect for Nolan's intelligence, for Wally Pfister's pin-sharp cinematography, and, sadly, for an acting talent tragically curtailed."
The Dark Knight,"The plot is often impossible to follow. And the film, though dark, isn't as deep as some have claimed."
The Dark Knight,An obvious improvement over its immediate predecessor...
The Dark Knight,"The first five-star blockbuster of the year has arrived, and in style."
The Dark Knight,"Shouldn't Nolan, marvellous as his directing here is, be creating original films rather than rebooting and retooling franchise fare?"
The Dark Knight,"Watching the first dizzying, vertiginous overhead shot of the glittering skyscrapers and minuscule streets, I literally forgot to breathe for a second or two, and found myself teetering forward on my seat..."
The Dark Knight,...a movie that fulfills the promise of the best Hollywood movies in that it offers us transport to an alternate yet recognizable reality.
The Dark Knight,"Believe the hype. The Dark Knight is, quite simply, the superhero of superhero films."
The Dark Knight,"A product of these troubled times, the sequel to 2005's Batman Begins includes nods to terrorism, domestic surveillance and even sanctioned torture. But one of its greatest feats is to capture our collective anxiety over the resurgent politics of hope."
The Dark Knight,"Lo mejor, por lejos: la descollante actuación póstuma de Heath Ledger como el Guasón definitivo. Quizás el primer blockbuster de culto del siglo XXI."
The Dark Knight,Everything you've heard is true...brilliant.
The Dark Knight,"Hugely entertaining, superbly acted and stunningly designed blockbuster that mixes adult themes with spectacular action and actually leaves you wanting more, despite its lengthy running time."
The Dark Knight,"thanks to an atypically meaty screenplay, this might very well be the best superhero movie of all time, and is the only film in this genre that is so well crafted that it deserves some serious respect when Oscar season rolls around next year."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is both a brilliantly nihilistic, incredibly dark and richly layered filmgoing experience, and a painful reminder of what the film world lost with the senseless death of Heath Ledger."
The Dark Knight,It manages to bring together an action film and a thought piece. This is a lot more than we have come to expect from a comic book film.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is so thrillingly-executed, primeval and exhilarating, it will forever sear itself into your consciousness. It might also be the most intelligent blockbuster movie ever made."
The Dark Knight,"Batman and Robin it ain't; it's hard to believe ""The Dark Knight"" and Joel Schumacher's infamous camp extravaganza even came from the same universe, let alone the same franchise."
The Dark Knight,"this intelligent, remarkably responsible approach to some of the most pressing issues of our times will make The Dark Knight be remembered, and cherished, long after the summer is over."
The Dark Knight,"A must-see for Ledger alone, but there's more to it than that. If anything, the film is a grim portrait of our own paranoia, sense of hopelessness and selfishness."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is a film steeped in tragedy, sacrifice, and heroism, and the eternal struggle at its core gives it a resonance that makes it one for the ages."
The Dark Knight,"The action is devastating, high-wire and realistic."
The Dark Knight,The darkest and most clever of all of the superhero movies ever made.
The Dark Knight,"Nolan and company did such an incredible job with this and tied up all the loose ends so well, that it's hard to fathom what they could do and where they could go with a 3rd film. I sincerely hope there isn't another Batman film. You can't top perfection."
The Dark Knight,"Scripted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, The Dark Knight is laced with the depths of thematic aspiration that can catapult a summer tentpole into the realms of the mythic."
The Dark Knight,"A sinister epic that manages to turn its pulp, comic book source into complex and thrilling art for the masses."
The Dark Knight,Batman started out as a comic that grew gothic that has turned psychotic. The Dark Knight is one long movie about madness.
The Dark Knight,"Besides a couple of flaws and Batman's distractingly garbled voice, this is one entertaining superhero crime saga."
The Dark Knight,'The Dark Knight' boasts a visual splendor that matches its trenchant themes and inspired performances.
The Dark Knight,"A stupendous performance by the late Heath Ledger burns this incarnation of The Joker into our psyche as securely as did Jack Nicholson's. But even more than Nicholson, Ledger plays The Joker for real.."
The Dark Knight,"Good, but overrated."
The Dark Knight,The hardware is played down this time and the result is character intensive movie that just so happens to have some of the best special effects of the season.
The Dark Knight,"At one point, all of Gotham believes that Aaron Eckhart is Batman. Indie-man, maybe. Or Blonde with Split Chin-man. But I'd sooner believe that Val Kilmer is Batman. And what are the odds of that?"
The Dark Knight,"It plays with the same themes as a lot of other superhero movies, but is about something bigger."
The Dark Knight,"It is a supreme achievement in its genre. It doesn't transcend its comic book origins, but rather faithfully represents them, wholly unembarrassed to deliver its story on its own terms."
The Dark Knight,"Batman lives to absorb blame in order to save the worthy, and soldier (or speedbike) on."
The Dark Knight,"Impeccably acted, morally complex and crafted with across-the-board technical virtuosity...emerges fully formed as an American crime-movie classic."
The Dark Knight,"Without question one of the most demonic, pure incarnations of nightmarish instant classic movie villains, Heath Ledger's Joker self-mutilated danger junkie, misery loves company chaos freak in hellish warpaint may be gone, but will never be forgotten."
The Dark Knight,"Heath Ledger's performance was a strong contributor, but Christopher Nolan's writing and direction is the real star."
The Dark Knight,"You heard it here first: the late Heath Ledger will win an Academy Award for his defining, spine-tingling performance as The Joker."
The Dark Knight,"...in the world of movies based on comic book heroes, there are the new Batman films, and then there's everything else."
The Dark Knight,"Not just a comic book movie but a virtual dissertation on the nature of good and evil, as well as the thin line that sometimes separates them."
The Dark Knight,"A near flawless example of superhero cinema with marvelous performances, a top notch script, and direction that aims for a more adult audience..."
The Dark Knight,No wonder people were lined up long before midnight for the first showing.
The Dark Knight,"As the king of an amoral universe, as a purveyor of unrestricted evil for fun, Ledger's dastardly villain, attired as sort of a rotting Clarabell, has chosen his own damnation. He's jumped into an abyss he has dug himself, and he wants to pull us along."
The Dark Knight,Everything you would want to see in a movie... I wanted to applaud after every scene Heath Ledger performed... features Batman's most wonderful toys yet.
The Dark Knight,"Now you see it, now you don't."
The Dark Knight,"It's another step in Nolan's attempt to make action blockbusters more ""serious"" without stripping them of the genre's benefits."
The Dark Knight,"It has chases and crashes and fight scenes, including a somersaulting truck, but when it is over it is the wrenching choices, the internal confrontations, that reverberate."
The Dark Knight,Probably one of the better comic book stories filmed ... .
The Dark Knight,"Ver a figura claudicante, vulnerável e trágica de Batman mergulhar nas sombras de uma cidade desesperada por figuras heróicas é, desde já, umas das imagens mais fortes e tristes que o gênero já produziu."
The Dark Knight,Do not worry about going in with unrealistic expectations. Your expectations pale in comparison with what The Dark Knight is prepared to deliver.
The Dark Knight,"I'm betraying my childhood to concede this, but Nolan has finally topped Tim Burton's two twisted spectaculars."
The Dark Knight,"I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to see The Dark Knight in the IMAX format, DO! It's impressive beyond imagination."
The Dark Knight,A very exhausting film...something far more than just an entertainment.
The Dark Knight,"It's not a superhero movie, or a crime drama either. It's a horror movie -- an epic one, and a great one. Madness and mutilation are on the menu..."
The Dark Knight,"While it has it's small flaws, this new Batman installment is an impressive motion picture, largely made so by the performance of a greatly-missed talent."
The Dark Knight,"[Though] The Dark Knight is a film one can respect, it is very difficult to enjoy."
The Dark Knight,The Joker should be charged with the film's biggest crime: stealing the show.
The Dark Knight,A movie perfectly pitched to the nasty desperation of the times.
The Dark Knight,"The movie is relentlessly paced, as Nolan constantly pushes the film with nail-biting action sequences and resonant dialogue exchanges."
The Dark Knight,The best way to sum up the sheer brilliance that is The Dark Knight is to paraphrase a saying from the Comic Book Guy in The Simpsons: Best. Superhero movie. Ever!
The Dark Knight,"With only three short words comprising the film's enigmatic title, it also boasts three epic claims to fame: the role of a lifetime for the late Heath Ledger, one of the best films of 2008 and one of the greatest superhero films of all time."
The Dark Knight,"Far from offering traditional summer escapism...a brainy, action-packed morality play meant to throttle the audience, body and mind, for a solid 152 minutes and haunt them for days and weeks later."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight might be the first superhero movie that exudes a palpable sense of dread and menace that tugs at our nerves in a way that both disturbs and delights us.
The Dark Knight,Christopher Nolan's latest exploration of the Batman mythology steeps its muddled plot in so much murk that the Joker's maniacal nihilism comes to seem like a recurrent grace note.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is even more blazingly ambitious than its predecessor, the 2005 Batman Begins."
The Dark Knight,"The film is so relentlessly bleak that, paradoxically, its blackness is not given its full due. But this comic-book movie is more disturbing, and has more freakish power, than anything else I've seen all year."
The Dark Knight,"During the summer of 2008, at least, the price of a single movie ticket isn't likely to buy more on-screen entertainment value and cinematic ambition than The Dark Knight."
The Dark Knight,Believe every ounce of the hype surrounding The Dark Knight.
The Dark Knight,"Nolan hasn't just created another comic book film, but a well crafted solid engrossing thriller"
The Dark Knight,"Nolan and Co. do weave an enormous and gratifyingly textured tapestry of plot, giving unexpectedly affecting moments to characters we initially see as mere background figures."
The Dark Knight,"A drama about hard moral choices, 'The Dark Knight' is 'The Godfather' of superhero movies -- or, at least, 'The Departed.'"
The Dark Knight,Quite good. Nolan's visually sophisticated and well-acted sequel engages and even wows for about two hours of its 2 1/2 -hour run time.
The Dark Knight,Ambitious and relentlessly dark and altogether better than its predecessor.
The Dark Knight,Watching The Dark Knight is like gazing into a mirror on a waning moon night: chilling and mesmerizing.
The Dark Knight,"Ledger makes the Joker his, imbuing the character with such menace and genuine insanity I finally got a sense of what talent he really had."
The Dark Knight,"Like a symphony where every note is exactly where it needs to be, or a painting without a brushstroke wasted, The Dark Knight is an unabashed, unashamedly great film."
The Dark Knight,"Delves so deeply into the darkness that lurks in the hearts of men that it comes almost as a shock, bordering on euphoria, to find that it maintains a tenacious grip onto hope in the human potential for good."
The Dark Knight,"If a movie is only as good as its villain, then Dark Knight is a winner, hands down."
The Dark Knight,"Puts Nolan in the same league as Brian de Palma, Martin Scorsese and Michael Mann."
The Dark Knight,"The stunts are exciting, but here's an action movie where the bits in between feel like more than setup for the next set piece. We've seen Bat movies that wink, sink or stink; this one thinks."
The Dark Knight,Supremely satisfying for about a dozen different reasons. A great film.
The Dark Knight,Someone get the Batman a lozenge.
The Dark Knight,"Christian Bale is magnificent as the tortured hero, but the movie belongs to its freaky villain."
The Dark Knight,"Despite the tensions between its form and its function, The Dark Knight succeeds far more than it fails, and lingers provocatively in the mind."
The Dark Knight,"Oh, and if skin-crawling performances, complex storytelling, and profound ideas don't do it for you...did I mention that the film is completely badass?"
The Dark Knight,"This is a terrific movie, the action sequences are splendiferous, the acting impeccable but there's something missing at the heart of it. And it seems to be Batman."
The Dark Knight,"Heath Ledger's Joker is, in many ways, symbolic of Nolan's overall success with The Dark Knight; subtle and restrained, but always two shakes shy of bloody holocaust and a masterpiece of cinema that time will verify."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight illuminates courtesy of Ledger's brilliant interpretation of the madman.
The Dark Knight,"Ledger is magnificently malevolent. He creates a character who revels in mayhem, a criminal with no agenda other than to spread terror."
The Dark Knight,"A triumph in comic book movies...the best Batman movie ever made. But it is Ledger's demeanor--his body language, eye contact, and delivery--that gets under one's skin."
The Dark Knight,"At the core of what is undoubtedly the most intense, and even at times horrific, superhero movie yet made is Ledger's extraordinary performance."
The Dark Knight,"There is an exquisite order in the chaos, a fascist formality and video game surrealism that resists the forces of disintegration with a sort of superhuman determination."
The Dark Knight,"While the film may be a hell of a ride, it takes a hell of a long time for the ride to grind its way out of first gear."
The Dark Knight,"As promised, Heath Ledger is terrifying. Cruelty plus cleverness is a fearsome combination."
The Dark Knight,Nolan is clearly on the title character's wavelength and understands how a crisis of such magnitude might affect good men trying to do the right thing.
The Dark Knight,The late Heath Ledger will be missed because of his ability to make a green-haired clown into the most terrifying sight in recent memory.
The Dark Knight,[Gotham City] stands in for any of today's civilized nations and becomes ripe for thematic exploration. And Nolan wastes no chance to utilize this world for a tale about how fragile our morality is.
The Dark Knight,Batman becomes a supporting player to the characters of Dent and the Joker
The Dark Knight,Mixed with the flashes of absolute brilliance are long dead sections. The film left me more often bored than entertained. It's a certain candidate for my list of this year's most overrated movies.
The Dark Knight,"The Joker's scenes reveal a lean, mean thriller hidden inside a bloated superhero epic."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is a complex and violent tale of clashing egos. The disturbed verses the disturbing. And in the title, underline the word dark. Add an asterisk. Italicize dark's font. Make it bold and bigger."
The Dark Knight,"Director Christopher Nolan has crafted a Batman film of such devastating impact, it practically obliterates the memory of its predecessors -- including Nolan's own Batman Begins."
The Dark Knight,"Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, The Dark Knight goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind."
The Dark Knight,It's the new gold standard for superhero noir.
The Dark Knight,Tremendous fun.
The Dark Knight,This is the kind of movie going experience that people tell their grand kids about.
The Dark Knight,Ledger's manically endearing performance as the unhinged psycho giving both cops and crooks nightmares is so riveting that it makes you sad for all the roles he'll never have a chance to tackle.
The Dark Knight,Heath Ledger's bravura performance will glitter for as long as movies exist.
The Dark Knight,"...if, like me, you've always thought the Paul Dini/Bruce Timm animated version was tops, you should be pretty happy with what Christopher Nolan has done this time around."
The Dark Knight,An explosively provocative [film]. ... Exhilaratingly straightforward action sequences matched by moral complexity of a sort not usually associated with comic-book movie franchises.
The Dark Knight,"The whole thing would be worthwhile if for nothing else than the late Ledger's brilliant and creepy performance as the unhinged, deranged villain. Hopefully, his achievement will be remembered when film-award season comes around."
The Dark Knight,"Ambitious, flawed and erratically visionary, Batman is back."
The Dark Knight,"It's a movie about America, terrorism and the rule of law; about heroism and human nature. The dude in the bat suit is just window-dressing."
The Dark Knight,"Quite simply, when you see The Dark Knight, you're going to realize how truly awful the first wave of Batman films were."
The Dark Knight,"Where Batman Begins was largely about the considerable personal toll exacted by its hero's decision to fight back against the forces of evil while adhering to a code of honor, The Dark Knight expands those weighty themes to city scale."
The Dark Knight,A very good movie that falls short of greatness.
The Dark Knight,"Ledger's performance reigns over Nicholson's by taking evil to a new level. If you don't see this in theatres, then you are missing out on one of the biggest and best films in history."
The Dark Knight,"Dark Knight is epic, frightening, unforgettable, unstoppable, and every inch a classic Batman trial, brought to life with disquieting, mouth-slashing sincerity."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight succeeds as an action film, character study and metaphor for our own terrorism-obsessed time. Even the hoary device of suggesting a bond between the outcast hero and the outrageous criminal, misused in so many films, makes sense."
The Dark Knight,"The Godfather of summer movies. Yes, I mean it."
The Dark Knight,"For all The Dark Knight's occasionally bombastic excess, it sort of does top them all, and not only in star power and sheer number of things blown up."
The Dark Knight,"Under the fun summer blockbuster sheen lives an unnerving, serious, complex and ambitious crime epic about three good men with the courage to stand against evil."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, easily the strongest effort in the history of its genre and one of the best movies of the decade."
The Dark Knight,"Do not go gently into The Dark Knight. It's an electrifying, thought-provoking meditation on the modern wages of fear. And you haven't danced with the devil by the pale moonlight until Heath Ledger has taken your psyche for a twirl."
The Dark Knight,"Whatever the causes, the effects of The Dark Knight are subtle and powerful. It's rejuvenating, it renews the faith."
The Dark Knight,"The setting may be Gotham City, but the landscape is that of the unconscious, where archetypes roam unfettered by the restraints of the waking world."
The Dark Knight,"Locked in a struggle for Gotham's soul, this Batman and Joker are mesmerizing, unforgettable and, yes, complete."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight should not be remembered as the movie that took Heath Ledger out. Thanks primarily to him, it should be remembered as the movie that propelled fantasy action-thrillers to a higher level."
The Dark Knight,"Nolan has turned this comic book creation into almost Wagnerian opera, the characters going through more twists, turns and crescendos then any I could have ever imagined."
The Dark Knight,"I'm tired of the early Oscar talk too, but when you're talking the best performance in years, if not decades, it's worth talking about. The whole movie is worth the buzz. Christopher 'Slowly Revealing Myself To Be God' Nolan has done it again."
The Dark Knight,"[Ledger's] performance is also the most interesting thing in the film, and when the Joker is absent, The Dark Knight loses most of its energy and dynamism."
The Dark Knight,"This film is not only one of the year's best; it may well end up as the finest of 2008. At the very least, it deserves consideration for Best Picture and Best Director, along with the expected Oscar kudos for Ledger."
The Dark Knight,"See this one on the biggest screen you can (IMAX, ideally), and experience both the magic of top-notch technical filmmaking and the bittersweet pleasure of watching a young actor, gone too soon, giving a performance that won't be forgotten."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is better than you have heard and as good as you had hoped.
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is easily the most entertaining bummer of the summer.
The Dark Knight,"Let's face it: If you're any sort of pop-culture or movie freak, you're going to see this flick. And you should, just for Ledger."
The Dark Knight,Christopher Nolan's second Batman adventure is the rare blockbuster that left me engaged and thoughtful instead of bored and bummed out.
The Dark Knight,It's the standard-bearer for the school of comic-book movies that confuses pompousness with seriousness and popular mechanics for drama.
The Dark Knight,"You come away impressed, oppressed, provoked, and beaten down, holding on to Ledger's squirrelly incandescence as a beacon in the darkness."
The Dark Knight,A masterpiece of good and evil with Oscar-worthy performances and technical accomplishments that has the potential to impact the genre more than any film since Christopher Reeve put on red tights.
The Dark Knight,"Batman's dilemma in The Dark Knight is how to use his bad press, whether he will embrace it or continue to fight it."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight resounds with a throbbing topical undercurrent, its superficially good-versus-evil setup slowly revealed to be a complex examination of the ways in which democracies can, and must, combat zealotry."
The Dark Knight,"Nolan not only raises the bar for superhero movies, again, but also presses a summer full of comic-book movies under the heel of an impressive bat boot."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is grim, loud, ugly, mean and disjointed (four out of five ain't bad!); thus, as an evening of fanboy fodder it's very hard to beat: Call it The Dork Night."
The Dark Knight,"Ledger's Joker sports greasy, green-tinged hair and a permanent slouch. It's as if he had bad posture as a kid and things only got worse from there."
The Dark Knight,"My question is can a third episode -- one lacking the unforgettable, superlative performance of Heath Ledger -- possibly top the magnificence of The Dark Knight? I predict a very interesting Oscars next year."
The Dark Knight,"flat-out exhilarating, a roller-coaster plunge into the heart of darkness... and a tad exhausting"
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is a brilliant follow-up to Batman Begins
The Dark Knight,"Nolan has shown a new way to tell a superhero story, and it may turn out to be the only way to tell a story about heroes in this troublingly amoral time."
The Dark Knight,"I have no idea if Ledger will win the Oscar next year. James Dean didn't. However both men left us, albeit too soon, with performances that will endure forever."
The Dark Knight,A great work of contemporary cinema and easily the most artistically significant film ever made to ever inspire its own fast-food pizza tie-in.
The Dark Knight,"The most brilliantly complex, perfectly paced, nerve-jangling, moral-wrangling film ever based on a graphically detailed literary work and, dare I say, one of the most important American films to be made in years."
The Dark Knight,"Mixing bravura filmmaking with flat clichés in about equal amounts, The Dark Knight is all about dualism. Appropriately, the movie's half-inspired, half-frustrating."
The Dark Knight,"Shakespearean but overlong, The Dark Knight is two hours of heady, involving action that devolves into a mind-numbing 32-minute epilogue."
The Dark Knight,"Everything rides on the Joker's formidability as a villain who can carry that kind of weight. In his last role, Ledger makes us believe."
The Dark Knight,"It's still too long, especially for a comic-book movie. But with Ledger's last performance director Nolan was blessed with the gift of light."
The Dark Knight,"Ledger's mesmerizingly damaged agent provocateur is the film's dark heart, a presence so malevolently unpredictable that it remains palpable even when he's not on screen."
The Dark Knight,"Whatever trepidations Ledger may have had about taking on such an iconic role, he blows past them brilliantly, carrying The Dark Knight along with him."
The Dark Knight,"[Ledger gives] a fine performance regardless, and I wish the movie around it were more deserving."
The Dark Knight,"A thought-provoking morality tale about the descent into darkness of a vigilante superhero, an anarchistic and sadistic villain, and an ardent idealist whose dreams are shattered."
The Dark Knight,"Nihilistic, imaginative and emotionally gratifying, The Dark Knight is in many ways a groundbreaking triumph, and perhaps the best superhero film to date."
The Dark Knight,"It's jam-packed with flawlessly designed set-pieces and skullduggery, sure, but it's also shrouded in grim portent, overlaid with a filigree of despair, and, for good measure, covered in a patina of dire consequence."
The Dark Knight,"As much as this is Ledger's movie, that should not diminish the notable accomplishments of other key cast members."
The Dark Knight,"Walking out to your own city's streets afterward, you'll likely have a ""Hey, this isn't Gotham!"" moment. It's a level of transportation that no cackling, Kool Aid-colored villain could achieve, but it's what every comic book fan truly wants."
The Dark Knight,"Christopher Nolan wanted to make an action movie that was different from other action movies -- darker, more twisted, more despairing, more bleak -- and he has mostly succeeded in this latest Batman installment. He can thank Ledger for a lot of that."
The Dark Knight,"A superior sequel, remarkable for its blend of serious themes and crowd-pleasing action, with a performance by Heath Ledger that's a memorable coda to a career cut far too short."
The Dark Knight,"This is not merely a Batman movie. It is not merely a comic-book movie. It is not merely gripping summer entertainment. It is, with Wall-E, one of the two best mainstream films to be released all year and far and away the most hypnotic chiller."
The Dark Knight,"It's a comic-book movie, but it's also a dark and highly complex drama."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is a good -- not great -- superhero movie that crams as many ideas into its 2 1/2 hours as it can and still be considered a summer action picture.
The Dark Knight,"Among this summer's action films, Dark Knight is easily the best in show."
The Dark Knight,Remarkable for it's visionary thematic sprawl... and unforgettable for the individual performance of a single actor.
The Dark Knight,"Squaring off the best-ever Batman and the best-ever Joker would've been enough, but director Nolan sticks them inside an ensemble crime saga that should make Scorsese proud."
The Dark Knight,Elevates the genre. Ledger triumphs and I loved the bromance between Wayne/Batman and Harvey Dent. Why Maggie Gyllenhaal?
The Dark Knight,"To see it is to understand that Nolan and his co-writer brother Jonathan saw a chance to go deeper into familiar characters and mythology, a chance to meditate on darker-than-usual themes that have implications for the way we live now."
The Dark Knight,"From its grim palette to its wonderfully eerie score, a departure from what Hollywood has always told us a superhero film should be ... Complex, unsettling, and rewarding."
The Dark Knight,"Director Christopher Nolan, who cowrote this dense, dark story with brother Jonathan, has taken the comic book super hero movie onto another plateau...Post 9/11 themes dominate..."
The Dark Knight,See The Dark Knight and you're guaranteed an exceptionally dark night at the cinema. You'll also see the finest superhero movie in years -- no joke.
The Dark Knight,"Let it be said that [Ledger's is] such a fearless, fierce, menacing turn that comparisons with Jack Nicholson don't come into it. This is the definitive Joker."
The Dark Knight,It's one of this year's most haunting cinematic experiences.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is ahead of the curve, dense and demanding, an art film on a grand scale. It won't make you smile, but it will make you ponder this mesmerizing experience."
The Dark Knight,"The generation of consumers who swallow this pessimistic sentiment can't see past the product to its debased morality. Instead, their excitement about The Dark Knight's dread (that teenage thrall with subversion) inspires their fealty to product."
The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight is insurmountable fun.
The Dark Knight,"I previously have had my own auteurist doubts about Mr. Nolan's work, but after The Dark Knight, I may have to rethink my past reservations about Mr. Nolan's place in the 21st-century cinema."
The Dark Knight,"Nolan has shot The Dark Knight with the utmost confidence, and with a gleefully morbid sense of fun that prevents it from becoming oppressively bleak."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight packs in at least two films worth of action, suspense, spectacle, horror, and nuanced social commentary. You'll want to see it more than twice."
The Dark Knight,The Oscar talk is no hype.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight [sounds] like heavy stuff -- and it is. But I should add that Nolan also delivers the kick-ass goods, from an opening bank heist a la Michael Mann to a climactic episode of vehicular mayhem a la William Friedkin."
The Dark Knight,"Nolan paints an inky portrait of a city falling apart, and in a movie rife with two-faced masquerading freaks, the Joker is merely the least conflicted of the bunch. Ledger's work is improbably droll, impossibly creepy, meticulously detailed."
The Dark Knight,"Twisted, tortured, terrifying -- and terrific."
The Dark Knight,Takes the expectations attached to superhero movies and subverts and reverses them in unexpected ways.
The Dark Knight,"Ledger slips into the purple suit as if it were an animal skin for a primal, archetypal dance...Nolan's richly realized adaptation of a modern American mythology fulfills our faith in the material and its interpreters."
The Dark Knight,"Iron Man and even more so The Dark Knight move the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some comic-book readers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes."
The Dark Knight,"Analyzing the successes of such a blistering, genre-defining masterwork (I'm already slipping) is tantamount to judging the contours of Michelangelo's David or evaluating the shading and form of Da Vinci's The Last Supper."
The Dark Knight,"From the start, it drags us down to the fiery pits of Gotham's anarchic hell and never lets us up for air; it is a bruising, unrelenting slice of sensory overload, a captivating spectacle as likely to dazzle the eyes as fray the nerves."
The Dark Knight,"Freed from the confines of an origin story, director Christopher Nolan lets loose with an intense, challenging, flawed and, yes, dark vision of Gotham under siege, featuring an unforgettable final performance by Heath Ledger as the clown prince of crime."
The Dark Knight,"The movie may fall shy of greatness, but that's not for lack of trying."
The Dark Knight,"Plodding, puffed-up kitsch mistaking itself for profound psycho noir that the source material won't support."
The Dark Knight,"It's an action-filled crime drama revolving around a dangerous, demented anarchist. Once again, the Joker's wild!"
The Dark Knight,Nolan cements his position as Hollywood's premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts.
The Dark Knight,"Visually arresting, with an awards-worthy performance from the late Heath Ledger -- the story bogs down in subplots and subplots to subplots."
The Dark Knight,"Batman takes a fierce stance in favor of untruth, surveillance and (but?) the American way. Bruce Wayne says, 'Batman has no limits,' and there are two sides to that coin."
The Dark Knight,"While The Dark Knight has all the visual flair and breathtaking action sequences you'd want in this kind of movie, the screenplay by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan keeps the human element front and center."
The Dark Knight,"It's a dark epic, but thankfully, there are some moments of comic relief."
The Dark Knight,"If Dark Knight is a nightmare of particularly modern neuroses, then Batman/Bruce Wayne are a tiny ray of hope upon awakening."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is 152 minutes long but is transfixing and all-enveloping, rather than arduous."
The Dark Knight,It's proof that popcorn entertainments don't have to talk down to their audiences in order to satisfy them. The bar for comic-book film adaptations has been permanently raised.
The Dark Knight,"Holy hyperbole, Batman! The best superhero movie ever is also the best movie of the year so far."
The Dark Knight,THE DARK KNIGHT is a spectacular piece of storytelling. It is as giant a leap forward from BATMAN BEGINS as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was to STAR WARS.
The Dark Knight,"Nolan has provided movie-goers with the best superhero movie to-date, outclassing previous titles both mediocre and excellent, and giving this franchise its Empire Strikes Back."
The Dark Knight,"In this, the last performance he completed before his death, Ledger had a maniacal gusto inspired enough to suggest that he might have lived to be as audacious an actor as Marlon Brando, and maybe as great."
The Dark Knight,"Dark Knight is I suppose the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it's so far beyond the genre that attempting to compare it with likes of Spider-Man, is almost laughable."
The Dark Knight,There is no other way to put this: The Dark Knight is bloody brilliant and you should go see it!
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight may be the first movie of its kind to substantively, intellectually address the mythos of comic-book action in something vaguely resembling the real world."
The Dark Knight,This movie is too in love with itself to make you love it.
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is noisy, jumbled, and sadistic."
The Dark Knight,"This is a rich, complex, visually thrilling piece of pop entertainment, as strong as any superhero epic we've ever seen."
The Dark Knight,"This movie is grim and jammed together. The narrative isn't shaped coherently to bring out contrasts and build toward a satisfying climax. The Dark Knight is constant climax; it's always in a frenzy, and it goes on forever."
The Dark Knight,"Nolan wants to prove that a superhero movie needn't be disposable, effects-ridden junk food, and you have to admire his ambition."
The Dark Knight,"An epic that will leave you staggering from the theater, stunned by its scope and complexity. It's also, thankfully, a vast improvement over his self-serious origin story, 2005's Batman Begins."
The Dark Knight,I loved The Dark Knight... It's unbelievably dark and uncompromised; it's the film noir we deserve for our terrifying 21st century.
The Dark Knight,"There's a sense of daring in this explosive Batman film, in which we constantly feel on edge, aware of the impending risks and that there is something to lose."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is bound to haunt you long after you've told yourself, Aah, it's only a comic-book movie."
The Dark Knight,"This is not a Batman movie -- this is a 2008 version of The Untouchables with The Batman as Elliot Ness, The Joker as Al Capone, and much better toys."
The Dark Knight,"Daring and uncompromisingly different from previous incarnations of Batman, Nolan hasn't redefined the superhero genre as much as created an unforgettable piece of crime fiction within the context of that realm."
The Dark Knight,"A dark, ambitious, mature and gritty crime saga the likes of which Michael Mann or Martin Scorsese would be proud to call their own."
The Dark Knight,"An ambitious, full-bodied crime epic of gratifying scope and moral complexity, this is seriously brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every expectation raised by its hit predecessor and then some."
The Dark Knight,"The ideas here are not new to the movie world of cops and criminal, but in the context of a comic book movie, they ring out with startling clarity."
The Dark Knight,"The film is quite special but where some films can weather extraneous or padded scenes, The Dark Knight has some distracting bloat to it which keeps it out of masterpiece territory."
The Dark Knight,"The Dark Knight is not only the best film I have seen this year, but quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made."
The Dark Knight,"Nolan's sequel surpasses the original with an intense, disturbing masterpiece."
The Dark Knight,"Dark, grim, haunting and inventive, Dark Knight is nothing short of brilliant, representing Chris Nolan's most accomplished and mature work to date and the best and scariest comic-hero adaptation you're likely to see this summer, perhaps the whole year."
The Dark Knight,The haunting and visionary Dark Knight soars on the wings of untamed imagination.
